			<b>Services Connect Buyers and Sellers.</b>  The Company

			our Services will connect Sellers to other users who will help 
			Sellers list items for sale on the Company Properties by taking 
			photographs, writing descriptions and posting the items in return 
			for a commission in the event the items are sold (<b>"Pixters"</b>).  
			Sellers, Buyers and Pixters, collectively, are referred to

								such ADR Provider, except to the extent such rules are in

								The ADR Provider and the parties must comply with the 
								following rules: (1) the arbitration shall be conducted by 
								telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, 
								the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the 
								arbitration; (2) all arbitration proceedings shall be held in

			<b>Application.</b>  When you apply to become a Pixter, you will 
			be prompted to disclose certain information about yourself.  You 
			promise that all information that you provide will be accurate, 
			complete and truthful, to the best of your knowledge, and you 
			expressly consent to our sending identifying information, such as 
			your name, photograph, profile and/or contact phone number, to 
			prospective Sellers.  By registering to become a Pixter, you 
			agree to use your best efforts to perform the Pixter Services 
			described at <a href="http://www.pixiboard.com/pixter"> http://www.pixiboard.com/pixter</a>
			
		</li>
		
		<br>
		<li align = "justify">
		
			<b>Pixter Services.</b>  If we notify you that we have accepted 
			your application to become a Pixter, you will be notified of 
			the next training session that we will hold for new Pixters.  
			Once you have successfully attended a training session, you will 
			be eligible to perform Pixter Services. When a prospective 
			Seller submits a request for Pixter Services, we will select 
			the Pixter who will be invited to provide the Pixter Services 
			for that prospective Seller. You acknowledge and agree that we 
			do not and cannot guarantee the volume of work that we will be 
			able to provide to you after you have completed your training.  
			Each time we send you an email or text message inviting you to 
			provide Pixter Services for a prospective Seller who wishes to 
			post one or more items (a <b>"Pixter Engagement"</b>), your 
			failure to respond to our email or text message within 4 hours 
			(the <b>"Response Period"</b>) shall be deemed to be your 
			refusal to accept that Pixter Engagement, and we will be free 
			to select another Pixter to provide such services.
		
		</li>
		
		<br>
		<li align = "justify">
		
			<b>Other Activities.</b>  You agree that as long as you are 
			providing services as a Pixter you will not perform, or agree 
			to perform, any services, yourself or for a third party, which 
			are competitive with the Company's Services, and that you will 
			not directly or indirectly solicit, induce, or attempt to 
			induce any User to terminate his or her relationship with the 
			Company in order to become a User of or with a competitive 
			service.
		
		</li>
		
		<br>
		<li align = "justify">
		
			<b>Payment.</b>  The Company will pay Pixter a fee for each 
			Pixter Engagement which results in the sale of an item by the 
			Seller, in accordance with the fee schedule posted on the 
			Company's website at 
			<a href="https://www.pixiboard.com/pixter"> https://www.pixiboard.com/pixter</a>. 
			The fee shall be paid within 10 days of the end of the month 
			in which the sale transaction occurs.

			<b>Independent Contractor Relationship.</b>  Nothing in 
			these Terms is intended or should be construed to create a 
			partnership, joint venture or employer-employee 
			relationship between the Company and you or between any 
			User and you.  You will take no position with respect to 
			or on any tax return or application for benefits, or in 
			any proceeding directly or indirectly involving the 
			Company that is inconsistent with your being an 
			independent contractor (and not an employee) of the 
			Company.  You are not the agent of the Company or any 
			User, and you are not authorized, and must not represent 
			to any third party that you are authorized, to make any 
			commitment or otherwise act on behalf of the Company or 
			any User.  Without limiting the generality of the 
			foregoing:

					<b><u>Benefits and Contributions.</u></b>  You are not 
					entitled to or eligible for any benefits that the Company 
					may make available to its employees, such as group insurance, 
					profit-sharing or retirement benefits.  Because you are an 
					independent contractor, the Company will not withhold or 
					make payments for social security, make unemployment insurance 
					or disability insurance contributions, or obtain workers' 
					compensation insurance on your behalf.  If, notwithstanding the 
					foregoing, you are reclassified as an employee of the Company, or 
					any affiliate of the Company, by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, 
					the U.S. Department of Labor, or any other federal, state or 
					foreign agency as the result of any administrative or judicial 
					proceeding, you agree that you will not, as the result of such 
					reclassification, be entitled to or eligible for, on either a 
					prospective or retrospective basis, any employee benefits under 
					any plans or programs established or maintained by the Company.
				
				</li>
			
				<br>
				<li align = "justify">
				
					<b><u>Taxes.</u></b>  You are solely responsible for filing 
					all tax returns and submitting all payments as required by any 
					federal, state, local or foreign tax authority arising from 
					the payment of Fees to you under this Agreement, and you agree 
					to do so in a timely manner.  If applicable, the Company will 
					report the Fees paid to you under this Agreement by filing Form 
					1099-MISC with the Internal Revenue Service as required by law.
				
				</li>
				
				<br>
				<li align = "justify">
				
					<b><u>Compliance with Law.</u></b>  You will comply with all
