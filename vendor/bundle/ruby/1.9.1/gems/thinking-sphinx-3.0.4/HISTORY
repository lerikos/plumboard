2013-07-09: 3.0.4
* [CHANGE] Updating Riddle dependency to be >= 1.5.7.
* [FEATURE] ts:regenerate rake task for rebuilding Sphinx when realtime indices are involved.
* [FEATURE] ts:clear task removes all Sphinx index and binlog files.
* [CHANGE] Glaze now responds to respond_to? (@groe).
* [FEATURE] Facet search calls now respect the limit option (which otherwise defaults to max_matches) (Demian Ferreiro).
* [FEATURE] Excerpts words can be overwritten with the words option (@groe).
* [FIX] Empty queries with the star option set to true are handled gracefully.
* [CHANGE] Deleted ActiveRecord objects are deleted in realtime indices as well.
* [CHANGE] Realtime callbacks are no longer automatically added, but they're now more flexible (for association situations).
* [CHANGE] Cleaning and refactoring so Code Climate ranks this as A-level code (Philip Arndt, Shevaun Coker, Garrett Heinlen).
* [FIX] Excerpts are now wildcard-friendly.
* [FIX] Facet searches now use max_matches value (with a default of 1000) to ensure as many results as possible are returned.
* [CHANGE] Exceptions raised when communicating with Sphinx are now mentioned in the logs when queries are retried (instead of STDOUT).
* [CHANGE] Excerpts now use just the query and standard conditions, instead of parsing Sphinx's keyword metadata (which had model names in it).
* [FIX] The settings cache is now cleared when the configuration singleton is reset (Pedro Cunha).
* [FEATURE] The :facets option can be used in facet searches to limit which facets are queried.
* [FIX] Escaped @'s in queries are considered part of each word, instead of word separators.
* [FIX] Internal class name conditions are ignored with auto-starred queries.
* [FEATURE] A separate role can be set for Sphinx actions with Capistrano (Andrey Chernih).
* [FIX] RDoc doesn't like constant hierarchies split over multiple lines.
* [CHANGE] Get database connection details from ActiveRecord::Base, not each model, as this is where changes are reflected.
* [CHANGE] Default Sphinx scopes are applied to new facet searches.
* [FEATURE] Facet searches can now be called from Sphinx scopes.

2013-05-07: 3.0.3
* [CHANGE] Updating Riddle dependency to be >= 1.5.6
* [FEATURE] INDEX_ONLY environment flag is passed through when invoked through Capistrano (Demian Ferreiro).
* [FEATURE] use_64_bit option returns as cast_to_timestamp instead (Denis Abushaev).
* [FIX] Update to association handling for Rails/ActiveRecord 4.0.0.rc1.
* [CHANGE] Delta jobs get common classes to allow third-party delta behaviours to leverage Thinking Sphinx.
* [FEATURE] Collection of hooks (lambdas) that get called before indexing. Useful for delta libraries.
* [FIX] Cast and concatenate multi-column attributes correctly.
* [FIX] Don't load fields or attributes when building a real-time index - otherwise the index is translated before it has a chance to be built.
* [CHANGE] Raise ThinkingSphinx::MixedScopesError if a search is called through an ActiveRecord scope.
* [FIX] Default search panes are cloned for each search.
* [FIX] Index-level settings (via set_property) are now applied consistently after global settings (in thinking_sphinx.yml).
* [FIX] All string values returned from Sphinx are now properly converted to UTF8.
* [CHANGE] GroupEnumeratorsMask is now a default mask, as masks need to be in place before search results are populated/the middleware is called (and previously it was being added within a middleware call).
* [FIX] The default search masks are now cloned for each search, instead of referring to the constant (and potentially modifying it often).
* [CHANGE] The current_page method is now a part of ThinkingSphinx::Search, as it is used when populating results.

2013-03-23: 3.0.2
* [CHANGE] per_page now accepts an optional paging limit, to match WillPaginate's behaviour. If none is supplied, it just returns the page size.
* [FEATURE] Ruby 2.0 support.
* [FEATURE] Rails 4.0.0 beta1 support.
* [FIX] :utf8? option within index definitions is now supported, and defaults to true if the database configuration's encoding is set to 'utf8'.
* [FIX] indices_location and configuration_file values in thinking_sphinx.yml will be applied to the configuration.
* [CHANGE] Strings and regular expressions in ThinkingSphinx::Search::Query are now treated as UTF-8.
* [FIX] Primary keys that are not 'id' now work correctly.
* [CHANGE] Setting a custom framework will rebuild the core configuration around its provided settings (path and environment).
* [CHANGE] Search masks don't rely on respond_to?, and so Object/Kernel methods are passed through to the underlying array instead.
* [FIX] Search options specified in index definitions and thinking_sphinx.yml are now used in search requests (eg: max_matches, field_weights).
* [FEATURE] Indexes defined in app/indices in engines are now loaded (Antonio Tapiador del Dujo).
* [FIX] Custom association conditions are no longer presumed to be an array.
* [CHANGE] Empty search conditions are now ignored, instead of being appended with no value (Nicholas Klick).
* [CHANGE] Custom conditions are no longer added to the sql_query_range value, as they may involve associations.
* [FIX] Capistrano tasks use the correct ts rake task prefix (David Celis).
* [FEATURE] Query errors are classified as such, instead of getting the base SphinxError.

2013-02-04: 3.0.1
* [FEATURE] Provide Capistrano deployment tasks (David Celis).
* [FEATURE] Allow specifying of Sphinx version. Is only useful for Flying Sphinx purposes at this point - has no impact on Riddle or Sphinx.

* [FIX] Referring to associations via polymorphic associations in an index definition now works.
* [FEATURE] Mysql2::Errors are wrapped as ThinkingSphinx::SphinxErrors, with subclasses of SyntaxError and ParseError used appropriately. Syntax and parse errors do not prompt a retry on a new connection.
* [CHANGE] Use connection pool for search queries. If a query fails, it will be retried on a new connection before raising if necessary.
* [CHANGE] Glaze always passes methods through to the underlying ActiveRecord::Base object if they don't exist on any of the panes.
* [FIX] Don't override foreign keys for polymorphic association replacements.
* [FIX] Quote namespaced model names in class field condition.
* [FEATURE] Polymorphic associations can be used within index definitions when the appropriate classes are set out.
* [FEATURE] Allow custom strings for SQL joins in index definitions.
* [FIX] New lines are maintained and escaped in custom source queries.
* [FIX] Subclasses of indexed models fire delta callbacks properly.
* [FIX] Thinking Sphinx can be loaded via thinking/sphinx, to satisfy Bundler.

* [FIX] New lines are maintained and escaped in sql_query values.

2013-01-02: 3.0.0
* [CHANGE] Updating Riddle dependency to 1.5.4.
* [FIX] Respect source options as well as underlying settings via the set_property method in index definitions.
* [FIX] Load real-time index definitions when listing fields, attributes, and/or conditions.
* [CHANGE] UTF-8 is now the default charset again (as it was in earlier Thinking Sphinx versions).
* [FEATURE] Initial realtime index support, including the ts:generate task for building index datasets. Sphinx 2.0.6 is required.
* [CHANGE] Removing ts:version rake task.
* [FEATURE] SphinxQL connection pooling via the Innertube gem.

2012-12-22: 3.0.0.rc
* [FEATURE] Source type support (query and ranged query) for both attributes and fields. Custom SQL strings can be supplied as well.
* [FEATURE] Wordcount attributes and fields now supported.
* [FEATURE] Support for Sinatra and other non-Rails frameworks.
* [FEATURE] A sphinx scope can be defined as the default.
* [FEATURE] An index can have multiple sources, by using define_source within the index definition.
* [FEATURE] sanitize_sql is available within an index definition.
* [FEATURE] Providing :prefixes => true or :infixes => true as an option when declaring a field means just the noted fields have infixes/prefixes applied.
* [FEATURE] ThinkingSphinx::Search#query_time returns the time Sphinx took to make the query.
* [FEATURE] Namespaced model support.
* [FEATURE] Default settings for index definition arguments can be set in config/thinking_sphinx.yml.
* [FIX] Correctly escape nulls in inheritance column (Darcy Laycock).
* [FIX] Use ThinkingSphinx::Configuration#render_to_file instead of ThinkingSphinx::Configuration#build in test helpers (Darcy Laycock).
* [FIX] Suppressing delta output in test helpers now works (Darcy Laycock).
* [FEATURE] A custom Riddle/Sphinx controller can be supplied. Useful for Flying Sphinx to have an API layer over Sphinx commands, without needing custom gems for different Thinking Sphinx/Flying Sphinx combinations.

2012-10-06: 3.0.0.pre
* First pre-release. Not quite feature complete, but the important stuff is certainly covered. See the README for more the finer details.
