    Pixiboard&#0153; is an online and mobile visual marketplace designed for local buying, selling, and bartering.  We started Pixiboard because 
    we could not believe that there was not a better way to share items, ads, and services than to post them on messy bulletin boards 
    on college campuses, pin them to back wall corkboards in cafes, or bury them in overcrowded classified advertisement websites.<br><br>
    Pixiboard empowers people to connect with others locally.  Users are able to build rapport and check out buyers and sellers through features like 
    commenting on items, browsing user profiles, rating experiences, and messaging private communiques to set-up item exchanges.  More importantly, 
    with Pixiboard's secure PixiPay&#0153; payment engine the days of carrying cash into dark meeting spots are gone forever.<br><br>
    At Pixiboard, our mission is to make local commerce frictionless and safe for everyone.  We envision an fully integrated platform that fixes the 
    process of local buying, selling, and bartering from the ground up.  Beyond just another fancy user interface, we are fundamentally 
    rethinking how the experience of exchanging local goods and services works.<br><br>
    Share.  Connect.  Magic.<br>
