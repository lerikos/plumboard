1,What is Pixiboard?,"Pixiboard&#0153 is an online and mobile marketplace that brings local buyers and sellers together in an easy-to-use, safe and secure community, eliminating the problems and hassles with current systems.  Pixiboard uses the power of the image to more effectively connect people with products and services they want to buy or sell.  Sellers share their pixis (pictures or videos).  Buyers browse images of what they are looking for; see the location and seller; identify the price they are willing to pay; and connect to the one they want.  Like magic, the deal is made."
2,What is a “pixi”?  ,"A pixi is a quality picture(s) or video of the good or service you want to sell, promote, or barter."

<br>
To participate, you must sign-up.  Once you are a registered user, you can buy or sell to your heart’s content.  As a Seller, you create a pixi for the item you want to move; post the pixi, add a description, and set a location and price; publish; and wait for the buyer requests to come to your e-mail.  As a Buyer, you can browse items by category, location, or keyword.  You can let the seller know you want to buy this item now or ask the seller for more information through our private messaging service."
4,Do I have to register to browse?,"Heck no.  Browse all posted items for as long as you want.  Once you identify something you want to buy or something you want to post, you will then need to login or register.  It doesn’t hurt to look and, in this case, there is nothing to break (so you won’t have to buy it)."
5,How do I pay for items?,"Pixiboard uses a safe and secure payment environment called PixiPay&#0153.  Within PixiPay&#0153, use your debit/credit card, or bank account to make or receive payments anywhere, anytime.  PixiPay™ eliminates the need to carry wads of cash or make change at the point of sale.  Simply login, send or accept the invoice, and you are done."
6,Is it safe?,Pixiboard creates a trusted community to buy and sell your stuff.  We work hard to eliminate anonymous buyers and sellers by requiring a certain level of commitment from participants.  Users rate each other and the transactions to build up reputations in the Pixicommunity.  PixiPay™ eliminates the cash exchange element of the transaction.  Users do not need to worry about carrying around wads of cash or making change.  Make the deal online and close the transaction at the exchange location using your computer or mobile device.  No anonymous users. No sketch.

For high volume and/or corporate accounts, subscriptions are available for monthly billing."
11,What is the charge on each pixi sold?,"Since Pixiboard is a sharing community, the transaction fee is shared between the buyer and seller.  Each pays $1 or 1% of the final sale price whichever is higher."
12,How do I dispute a transaction?,"All transactions are final.  In the event that there’s a problem with your transaction, a credit towards a future pixi purchase will be granted."
